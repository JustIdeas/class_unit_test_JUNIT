The Idea of this project is to get a random class (developed by someone) and create unit test for it.

The main fo is to test the account (conta) class, but I did create some tests for the other classes too, using JUNIT (for JAVA).

For better understanding, I suggest that you take look inside of each test to better visualize what I have tried to do.

To run this project, you have to install all dependices on the pom.xml file and run like below, inside of the test folder:
mvn clean test
You can use the Test functionality that the visual studio has.
